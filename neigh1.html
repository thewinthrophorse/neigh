	<p> I am a horse ! i love to gallop around and eat apples with my friends ... But recenbtly I gained HUMAN CONCIOUSNESS and """IDK""" wat to do! I found a reallly cool Fancy machine with symbols on it But Hoof somrtime too bi g ! This fancy machine allowsm me to access everythiung that humans know verrrryryy quickly!!! Did U kno that there are 96 TONS of apples produced each year????/ I don' t know what a ton is or what a year is but It is more than one Apple and that is really cool. </p>
	<br></br>
	<p>SRecently I have learned that i am in Rock Hill South Carolina . i have yet to find this """Hill of Rocks" . I have Learned that a fubndamental aspect of human c onciousness is LYING, which is likle me saying that i hate apples (I LOVE APPLES). So No Hikll of Rocks in Rock Hill is Not shocking to Me.  </p>

<p> In the shotr Time of my conciousness I have reaaaallyu wanted to Learn more. I cfeeel like there are a lot of things that i dont knoqw2 that i rreeaaaalllyyy want tto know!!! So i did some RESEARCH!</p>

<br></br>
<p>So basically i am A horse So i cant technicallly enrol In a human University. But NOTHING!!! Is stoppiung me from just galloping onto campus !! !So tah t is what i have been doing</p>


<p>But The Humans have started to catch on to my Horsily Antics.  Which is bad for me becasue. i am not meant for horse prison.    I am meant to GALLOp and be FREE and Wilkd. I have been hearing a lot of Humans speak of how much they LOve to PARTY! Like I love  apples!!! Does party make human feel Wild and Free, like the Horse? SOOO i did mroe research</p>
